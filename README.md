# Votez App
A single-web-page app that utilizes `React`/`Redux` and `Node.js` to allow users vote polls.

## Getting Started

[Live Demo](https://votez-app.herokuapp.com/)

The app is based on one of [FreeCodeCamp's challenges](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-voting-app).

It meets the following criteria

> Story: As an authenticated user, I can keep my polls and come back later to access them.

>User Story: As an authenticated user, I can share my polls with my friends.

> Story: As an authenticated user, I can see the aggregate results of my polls.

> Story: As an authenticated user, I can delete polls that I decide I don't want anymore.

> Story: As an authenticated user, I can create a poll with any number of possible items.

> Story: As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see and vote on everyone's polls.

> Story: As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see the results of polls in chart form. (This could be implemented using Chart.js or Google Charts.)
